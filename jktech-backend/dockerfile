# Step 1: Use official Node.js image for building the app
FROM node:18 AS build

# Step 2: Set working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy package.json and package-lock.json (or yarn.lock) to install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./

# Step 4: Install dependencies
RUN npm install --frozen-lockfile

# Step 5: Copy the entire project to the container's working directory
COPY . .

# Step 6: Build the app (for NestJS, typically using TypeScript)
RUN npm run build

# Step 7: Create a second stage to create the production image (smaller image)
FROM node:18

# Step 8: Set working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 9: Copy only the necessary files from the build stage (node_modules and dist folders)
COPY --from=build /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=build /app/dist ./dist

# Step 10: Expose the port the app will run on (NestJS defaults to 3000)
EXPOSE 3000

# Step 11: Start the application in production mode
CMD ["node", "dist/main"]
