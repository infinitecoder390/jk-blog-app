# Step 1: Use Node.js image for building the app
FROM node:18-alpine AS build

# Step 2: Set working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy package.json and package-lock.json (or yarn.lock) to install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./

# Step 4: Install dependencies (includes React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Vite)
RUN npm install

# Step 5: Copy all the source files to the container
COPY . .

# Step 6: Build the Vite app
RUN npm run build

# Step 7: Serve the app using a lightweight web server (e.g., serve)
# Use Nginx or any server, but for simplicity we'll use `serve`
FROM serve:latest

# Step 8: Copy the build folder to the web server's directory
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Step 9: Expose the port
EXPOSE 80

# Step 10: Start the app with Nginx or `serve`
CMD ["serve", "-s", "/usr/share/nginx/html"]
